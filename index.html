<h1>Welcome to üßë‚Äçüíª+‚òï!</h1>
<p>
    This site serves primarily as a central hub for all of hobby work. 
    As I develop an interest in various topics, I tend to create minimum
    viable products that help me understand the topic a little better. This site 
    is where I post my findings. 
</p>
<p>
    If I'm dedicated enough to any singular project,
    I may post a link to a usable version (though this is rare). I'm also always exploring new ways to 
    publish my thoughts so the site itself is a bit of an experiment and may be unstable
    from time to time (ü§∑ it's better to break this production site than a production app at work!)
</p>
<p>
    That said, you can find some helpful links in the menu bar. By far, the <code>Blog</code>
    will contain the majority of the content. Please also stop by my <code>Mastodon profile</code> 
    to let me know that you've visited my site. While you're there, ask me a question, send me a meme, 
    or just say "Hi". I'm always excited to expand my circle of tech friends!
