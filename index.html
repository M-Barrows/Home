<h1>Welcome to üßë‚Äçüíª+‚òï!</h1>
<p>
    This site serves primarily as a central hub for all of hobby work. 
    As I develop an interest in various topics, I tend to create minimum
    viable products that help me understand the topic a little better. This site 
    is where I post my findings. 
    
    Historically, most of my projects have some ties to: 
    <ul style="margin-left: 4em;">
        <li>Python</li>
        <li>Machine Learning</li>
        <li>Dev/ML Ops</li>
        <li>Containers</li>
        <li>Data Visualization</li>
        <li>Automation</li>
    </ul>


    If I'm dedicated enough to any singular project,
    I may post a link to a usable version (though this is rare). I'm also always exploring new ways to 
    publish my thoughts so the site itself is a bit of an experiment and may be unstable
    from time to time (ü§∑ it's better to break this production site than a production app at work!)

    That said, you can find some helpful links in the menu bar. By far, the <code>Blog</code>
    will contain the majority of the content. Please also stop by my <code>Mastodon profile</code> 
    to let me know that you've visited my site. While you're there, ask me a question, send me a meme, 
    or just say "Hi". I'm always excited to expand my circle of tech friends!
